Abstract - This document describes the development of a software for 3D spatial representation of room impulse response measurements through a hedgehog plot.  As the direction, level and arrival time of the sound intensity of the reflections are indicated by the position, length and color of the hedgehog's spines, a deep analysis of sound field evolution can be done, combining the room plans and all the hedgehog’s graphical information. First order Ambisonics measurements are used, either A or B format. As well as impulse response measurements, sine sweep measurements and the inverse filter can be loaded too. A measurement of the Arthur Sykes Rymer Auditorium at the University of York was used to exemplify the software using, getting consistent and accurate results. The software code is written in python language and published online.
